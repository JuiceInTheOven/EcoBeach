\chapter{The Solution}

- Introduce sections

\section{Solution Approach}
Describe the solution approach on a high-level including advantages and drawbacks based on relevant literature 

- How do we want to solve the problems described in chapter 1?
    - Present the sub-sections which will go into detail with the topics related to answering the sub-problems
    - Something like: "To download satellite images from Cupernicus we want to create a resilient service that can be run periodically to scrape for satellite images on given geo locations. The solution approach for this sub-problem is described at a high-level in section x.x.x"
